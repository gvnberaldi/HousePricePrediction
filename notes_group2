41-CentralAir: remove, dependent with YearBuilt which is more indicative
42-Electrical: remove, low variance between groups
43-1stFlrSF: indicativo, high variance medium (merge TotalFeet?!)
44-2ndFlrSF: possible categorization
    - no 2nd floor
    - 2nd floor small
    - 2nd floor big
45-LowQualFinSF: remove - statistic test high p-value
46-GrLivArea: highly dependent, almost like TotalFeet?! (above ground only)
47-BsmtFullBath: not indicative, =3 one instance only, when =2/3 not discriminant, when =0 medium/low
                 in case, convert from int to object and the from object to category
48-BsmtHalfBath: stattest hight p-value, discard it
49-FullBath: good prediction value, high IG
50-HalfBath: IG not too high, possibly removed, not so good prediction value
51-BedroomAbvGr (aka Bedroom): less indicative, IG low, candidate to remove
52-KitchenAbvGr (aka Kitchen): low variance, only when =1 we have high price
53-KitchenQual: high IG, possible binarization: Gd, Ex, Fa+TA+Po
54-TotRmsAbvGrd: linear trend w.r.t price (correlation with Bedrooms or merge with totalRooms)
55-Functional: low variability, low prediction value, remove it, p-value=0.03
56-Fireplaces: good discriminant bit not so indicative, maybe binarization to Yes/No
57-FireplaceQu: to remove (Fireplaces says the same)
58-GarageType: possible categorization, good prediction value
59-GarageYrBlt: (YearBuilt?!) strong correlation with YearBuilt, 
    - conversion from object to int64
    - instances with zero value removed
    - to int64, remove NA value (we assume no garage)
60-GarageFinish: good predictor for HIGH and LOW
    - to category
61-GarageCars: good predictor, 0,1 -> LOW , 2 -> medium , 3 -> HIGH/medium
    - to category ordinal 
62-GarageArea: very gooood !!!!!! , see correlation with GarageCars, we saw ;)
    - to int
63-GarageQual: not so good, low variability
    - to category
64-GarageCond: the same of GarageQual
    - to category
65-PavedDrive: not discriminant attribute, blaaa
    - to category
66-WoodDeckSF: not a good attribute
    - to int
67-OpenPorchSF: not so good 
    - to int
68-EnclosedPorch: discard
    - to int
69-3SsnPorch: same of EnclosedPorch
    - to int
70-ScreenPorch: same of EnclosedPorch
    - to int
71-PoolArea: too low instances with pool, discard
    - to int
72-PoolQC: too NA, low variability, discard
    - to category
73-Fence: low variability :((((
    - to category
74-MiscFeature: low variability !!!! che schifo
    - to category
75-MiscVal: low variability, again
    - to int
76-MoSold: high variability, p-value very high
    - to categorical ordinal
77-YrSold: ohhhhh p-value high ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^, discard !
    - to int
78-SaleType: low variability
    - to category
79-SaleCondition: na merda
    - to category
