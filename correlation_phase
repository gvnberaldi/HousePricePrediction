1- MSSubClass: to see
1- LotArea: it is good, maybe binarization ? 
2- Neighborhood: to see, surely to aggregate in some categories
3- HouseStyle: too see, surely to aggregate in some categories
4- OverallQual: we believe that is significant! we can keep it as it is
5- YearBuilt: we can see that the more recent, the higher the price
6- YearRemodAdd: we can see that the more recent the remodeling of the house, the higher the value. We can keep this value, correlation con YearBuilt
7- Exterior1st: to see 
8- MasVnrType: to see correlation, we should change Na to None because it is the most frequent class (possibly add correlation with area)
    - to category
9- MasVnrArea: to see correlation, we changed to numeric, we replaced the Na with 0 (temporarirly) -> Is Interaction MasVnrType- MasVnrAre relevant???? Split in 3 categories??? It depends on the interaction!!!
10- ExterQual: to see, we can keep it as it is, however Poor is absent
11- Foundation: to see, maybe aggregation
12- BsmtQual: very good, aggregate NA+FA+Î¤A
13- BsmtFinType1: too see, catch high but with MEDIUM 
14- TotalBsmtFs: too see
15- 1stFlrSF: indicative, high variance medium (merge TotalFeet?!)
16- 2ndFlrSF: possible categorization
17- GrLivArea: highly dependent, almost like TotalFeet?! (above ground only)
18- FullBath: good prediction value, high IG
19- KitchenQual: high IG, possible binarization, Gd, Ex, Fa+TA+Po
20- TotRmsAbvGrd: to see, linear trend w.r.t price (correlation with Bedrooms or merge with totalRooms)
21- Fireplaces: to see, good discriminant bit not so indicative, maybe binarization to Yes/No
22- GarageType: possible categorization, good prediction value
23- GarageFinish: good predictor for HIGH and LOW
24- GarageArea: very gooood !!!!!! , see correlation with GarageCars, we saw ;)
